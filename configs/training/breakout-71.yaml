# Breakout 71 — YOLO training configuration
#
# Used by scripts/train_model.py and scripts/validate_model.py.
# Each game gets its own training config in configs/training/.
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/train_model.py --config breakout-71
#   python scripts/validate_model.py --config breakout-71

# Link to the game config (configs/games/<game>.yaml)
game: breakout-71

# YOLO object detection classes for this game
classes:
  - paddle
  - ball
  - brick
  - powerup   # coins in Breakout 71 (YOLO class maps to in-game coins)
  - wall

# Base model — Ultralytics pretrained checkpoint to fine-tune from
base_model: yolov8n.pt   # nano: fast, sufficient for simple game objects

# Dataset path — points to YOLO-format data.yaml prepared by prepare_dataset.py
# To regenerate: python scripts/prepare_dataset.py --source output/dataset_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
dataset_path: output/dataset_20260215_175739_yolo/data.yaml

# Training hyperparameters
epochs: 100
imgsz: 640
batch: 16
amp: false   # disabled for Intel XPU compatibility

# Device selection: "cpu" is fastest for this model on current hardware
device: cpu

# Output directory for trained weights (relative to project root)
output_dir: weights/breakout71

# Validation thresholds (lowered for initial auto-annotated dataset;
# raise back to 0.80/0.50 after human-reviewed annotations on Roboflow)
min_map50: 0.65        # minimum mAP@0.5 to consider training successful
min_map50_95: 0.50     # minimum mAP@0.5:0.95 (stricter metric)
