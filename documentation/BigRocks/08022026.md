# Big Rock – Minimal Breakout‑71 Perception + Control Loop

_Date: 2026-02-08_

## 1. Rename and clean the repo

- [x] Decide final repo name (e.g. `rsn-game-qa`).
- [x] Rename remote repo on Git host (Settings → rename).
- [x] Rename local folder to new repo name.
- [x] Update `origin` URL to point to the renamed remote.
- [x] Verify `git remote -v` and push once to confirm everything works.

- [x] Create top‑level structure:
  - [x] `perception/`
  - [x] `controllers/`
  - [x] `env/`
  - [x] `data/`
  - [x] `scripts/`

- [x] Add/update `README.md` with:
  - [x] One‑sentence project description.
  - [x] Section: “Current status” (Breakout‑71 controller prototype).
  - [x] Section: “How to run” with a minimal example command.

## 2. Simple Breakout‑71 controller stub

- [x] Decide: web version or Android for this first controller (Decision: Android).
- [x] Create `controllers/breakout_71_controller.py`

- [x] Implement basic loop:
  - [x] Open/connect to Breakout‑71 (instructions noted in comments).
  - [x] Read some form of “state” each step (for now can be a dummy value).
  - [x] Send paddle moves based on a trivial rule (e.g. alternate left/right, or move toward mouse).

- [x] Create `scripts/run_breakout_controller.py` that:
  - [x] Imports the controller.
  - [x] Runs the main control loop.
- [x] Manual test: start Breakout‑71, run the script, and confirm the paddle moves under program control.
