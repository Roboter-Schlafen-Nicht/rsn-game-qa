# Big Rock – Minimal Breakout‑71 Perception + Control Loop

_Date: 2026-02-08_

## 1. Rename and clean the repo

- [ ] Decide final repo name (e.g. `rsn-game-qa`).
- [ ] Rename remote repo on Git host (Settings → rename).
- [ ] Rename local folder to new repo name.
- [ ] Update `origin` URL to point to the renamed remote.
- [ ] Verify `git remote -v` and push once to confirm everything works.

- [ ] Create top‑level structure:
  - [ ] `perception/`
  - [ ] `control/`
  - [ ] `env/`
  - [ ] `data/`
  - [ ] `scripts/`

- [ ] Add/update `README.md` with:
  - [ ] One‑sentence project description.
  - [ ] Section: “Current status” (Breakout‑71 controller prototype).
  - [ ] Section: “How to run” with a minimal example command.

---

## 2. Simple Breakout‑71 controller stub

- [ ] Decide: web version or Android for this first controller (pick one).
- [ ] Create `control/breakout_controller.py` (or your language of choice).

- [ ] Implement basic loop:
  - [ ] Open/connect to Breakout‑71 (instructions noted in comments).
  - [ ] Read some form of “state” each step (for now can be a dummy value).
  - [ ] Send paddle moves based on a trivial rule (e.g. alternate left/right, or move toward mouse).

- [ ] Create `scripts/run_breakout_controller.py` that:
  - [ ] Imports the controller.
  - [ ] Runs the main control loop.
- [ ] Manual test: start Breakout‑71, run the script, and confirm the paddle moves under program control.

---

## 3. Perception placeholder for YOLO

- [ ] Create `perception/breakout_capture.py`.
- [ ] Implement `grab_frame()`:
  - [ ] Capture a screenshot of the game window/region.
  - [ ] Return it as an image/array object.

- [ ] Implement `detect_objects(frame)` stub:
  - [ ] Current implementation returns empty or mock detections.
  - [ ] Add TODOs for future YOLO integration (paddle, ball, bricks, coins, combo).

- [ ] Wire controller to perception:
  - [ ] In the controller loop, call `grab_frame()` each iteration.
  - [ ] (Optional today) Log one frame every N steps to `data/raw_frames/` for future labeling.

---

## 4. Wrap up

- [ ] Run the full loop (controller + perception stub) for a few minutes.
- [ ] Fix any obvious crashes or path issues.
- [ ] Commit with message: `feat: initial breakout controller and perception stubs`.
- [ ] Jot down 2–3 notes for next session (e.g. “decide on final capture method”, “prepare 10 labeled images”).
