# RSN Game QA — Roadmap

## Current Phase

Autonomous AI-driven game QA for browser-based games. The platform
captures gameplay via headless browsers, detects anomalies using
computer vision oracles, and trains RL agents to explore game states.

**Supported games:** Breakout71, Hextris, Shapez
**Stack:** Python 3.12, Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, YOLO, Selenium

## Detailed Roadmap

The full roadmap with implementation checklists is maintained
internally at `private/documentation/ROADMAP.md` (not shipped in the
public repo). Internal contributors can access it via the private
documentation directory.
