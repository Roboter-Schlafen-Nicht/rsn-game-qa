I’ll ask you a focused set of questions first, then I can turn your answers into a concrete discipline strategy tailored to you.

You don’t have to answer everything at once, but the more precise you are, the better the profile.

1. Energy and focus patterns
On a typical day (no travel), when do you feel sharpest for deep work (coding, RL, architecture)?

Late morning / early afternoon (11–15)

How long can you usually stay in unbroken deep focus if it’s interesting work?

4+ hours

What reliably kills your focus when you’re supposed to work on RSN?

Jumping between tasks/ideas
Fatigue from freelancing

1. Motivation and reward style
When you finish a hard task, what feels more motivating:

Crossing it off a list / seeing progress tracked
Just the intrinsic satisfaction

Do deadlines generally:

Only work when another person is involved

In the past, when you stuck to a routine for several months, what made it work?

Strong excitement about the project

1. Procrastination and derailers
When you procrastinate on RSN work, what do you usually do instead?

Freelance work (safe, billable)
YouTube / browsing / games
Errands / chores

Think of a recent weekend where you planned to do deep work and didn’t.
What were the top 1–2 reasons?

Social Events, burned out on the tasks

Which type of task do you delay the most?

Boring but necessary (docs, packaging, testing)

1. Structure and accountability
How do you prefer to manage tasks?

Simple Markdown lists / notes
Calendar‑driven (time blocks = tasks)

How do you feel about rigid schedules?

Love them; they reduce decision overhead.

Would you be open to:

A weekly “review ritual” (30–45 min) every Sunday? Yes

A short daily start‑of‑day check (5–10 min)? No

1. Values and identity
What would you say are your top 3 values for this phase of life?

autonomy, financial security, creativity

In one sentence:
“In 2026, I want to become the kind of person who I can be proud of”

Which statement feels most true:

“If I commit to a small, non‑negotiable habit, I usually keep it.”

“I’m great in sprints, but I fatigue over months.” MOST TRUE

“I overcommit and then renegotiate with myself a lot.”

If you answer these, I’ll:

Summarize a personality/work style profile (1–2 short paragraphs).

Design a discipline system for 2026 built around:

Your Fri–Sun RSN schedule,

Your typical energy curve,

How you actually respond to deadlines and motivation.
